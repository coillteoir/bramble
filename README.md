# Bramble - A Kubernetes Native CI/CD Framework

## Developer Experience
- Pipelines as Kubernetes manifests
- Pipelines can have handmade tasks or plug and play pre-applied tasks

### Demo ideas
- Pipelines to build, test, and deploy different components of Bramble
- C program to generate pngs, merging to master posts the generated image to instagram

### Current work and targets for 20th Jan
